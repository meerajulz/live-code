## Features

- **Increment**: Users can increase the count by clicking the 'Increment' button.
- **Decrement**: Users can decrease the count using the 'Decrement' button, with a safeguard that prevents the count from going below zero.
- **Reset**: Allows users to reset the count to zero if the count is greater than zero. This button is conditionally rendered only when the count is not zero.
