Search Functionality

Implement a search bar to allow users to search for products by name.
You should handle this on the frontend, filtering the results already fetched from the API.

Provide a dropdown menu or a set of buttons to filter products by their category.
Like the search functionality, handle this filtering on the frontend.
Product Detail Page

Clicking on a product card should navigate to a detailed view of the product, displaying more information such as the description, brand, and any other relevant data.
API Endpoint for single product: https://dummyjson.com/products/{id}
